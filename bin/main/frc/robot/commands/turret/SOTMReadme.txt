Our goal with Shoot on the Move is to allow the robot to accurately shoot from any position on the field while in motion. This will increase efficiency as to how many balls the robot can shoot per second. Our Shoot on the Move calculations are based on where the robot will be when it shoots and what velocity it will have. We accounted for both the linear and angular velocity of the robot and how much it will turn. We calculate what velocity the ball needs to have based on how far away the robot is from the target (both horizontal and vertcial distance). From this velocity, we subtract the predicted velocity of the robot because a ball leaving the robot will keep the robot's velocity. We use this velocity (as an xy-vector) to find the angle the turret needs to rotate to, and we use the magnitude of this velocity in 3 dimensions to find how fast the shooter needs to launch the ball. The turret then alligns itself to this angle and the shooter speeds up to the correct velocity. We hope to repeat this every scheduler cycle to keep the turret and shooter tracking the target and ready to shoot in motion. The driver will then be able to release the balls at any moment by pressing a button that makes the kicker feed the balls to the shooter. 

Limitations: The shooter can only go so fast, and if the required launch velocity of the ball requires the shooter to exceed this, it won't be able to shoot the ball. This happens if the robot is too far away from the target or moving away from the target too fast. If the robot's distance and angle wouldn't allow the ball to go through the outer and inner targets, then the ball will only be shot through the outer hole. If something is obstructing the path of the balls from the shooter to the target (robots, field components), it won't be able to shoot accurately. We're currently using odometry to find the robot's position, but we hope to implement vision to get more accurate measurements. This is currently all theoretical and probably won't be accurate until a lot of testing.
